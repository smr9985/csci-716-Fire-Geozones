    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p> When responding to a fire, it is important to get enough fire engine crews to the scene as quickly as possible in order to control the fire and prevent further harm to people and property. It is therefore important to dispatch the correct (i.e. closest) engines to the scene of the response. Rather than have dispatchers manually identify the closest engines to each fire, maps are drawn in advance that help dispatchers map potential incident scenes to their closest fire apparatuses. These maps are composed of “geozones,” which define for each region of the map an ordered list of fire apparatuses to dispatch to fires scenes in that region. When a fire requiring multiple engines occurs in a region, the first n engines from the list of the corresponding geozone are dispatched to the scene.</p>
    <p> Voronoi diagrams are composed of seeds and regions where each region contains all points closer to its corresponding seed than all other seeds. For our problem, we can model fire stations as seeds and geozones as the regions of a Voronoi diagram. Voronoi diagrams can be extended to create regions that share the same first k closest seeds. The ordering of these k closest seeds is the ordered list of fire engines to dispatch for that geozone. Additionally, various distance functions can be used for Voronoi diagrams, with Euclidean distance being the most commonly used. We may explore other simple distance functions that more closely correlate with the distance fire engines have to travel in order to reach a scene (e.g. Manhattan distance).</p>
